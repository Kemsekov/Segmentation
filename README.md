This is simple pytorch segmentation code that uses my library `kemsekov_torch` to define model and train it on dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizalkarim/flood-area-segmentation

You can replace dataset with your own.

To run it, install dependencies and run notebook!
I haven't done full training for it, i stopped at checkpoint of 33 epoch with test iou `0.68`

Here is samples
